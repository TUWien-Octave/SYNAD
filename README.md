# SYNAD: A Synthetic Object Injection Methodology for Enhanced Anomaly Detection

This repository has annotations for the 26 real anomalies we discovered in the *Nordland* summer sequence, as described in our paper:

> K. Rusý, F. Seiler, D. Breuss, A. Jantsch, “SYNAD: A Synthetic Object Injection Methodology for Enhanced Anomaly Detection,” ICMVA 2025* (accepted).  

These annotations let you **test anomaly-detection models on real railway hazards** and reproduce the experiments in Sections 5–6 of the paper.
